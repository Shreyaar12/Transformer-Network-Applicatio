# Transformer Network Applications: NER & QA

## Project Overview
This repository contains two distinct applications of Transformer Networks, focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. These projects utilize pre-trained models from the Hugging Face library and demonstrate the versatility of Transformer models in handling complex natural language processing tasks.

### Features
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Use of tokenizers and pre-trained Transformer models to identify and classify named entities in text.
- **Question Answering (QA)**: Implementation of Transformer models to perform extractive Question Answering tasks, fine-tuning pre-trained models for custom datasets.

## Installation
Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed:
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers library

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install torch # For PyTorch implementation
pip install tensorflow # For TensorFlow implementation
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the desired project (NER or QA).
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to see the models in action.
